      <h2>About Scratch</h2>
      <p>With Scratch, you can program your own interactive stories, games, and animations — and share your creations with others in the online community.<br>

Scratch helps young people learn to think creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively — essential skills for life in the 21st century.<br>

Scratch is designed, developed, and moderated by the Scratch Foundation, a nonprofit organization. It is provided free of charge.<br>
        
      <h2>Projects By Us</h2>
      <p> These are some projects that we have created on scratch and would like to share with you<br>
